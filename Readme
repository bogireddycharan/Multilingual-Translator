Goal is to Auto Detect the language typed and translate it to a specific language.

For this we are using transformer model Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-{src}-{trg}
For example we can give values like '
>>> src = 'fr'  # source language
>>> trg = 'en'  # target language

which means our english language given is translated to french

model names use the following format: Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-{src}-{tgt}
We can find the codes here https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/languages
